McDonald's is an American fast-food company. People love to eat at McDonald's every day, but it is a well-known fact that eating every day at
McDonald's is not good for health. It is suggested that people should avoid eating in McDonald's every day. So, McDonald's wants to provide a healthy diet
in breakfast, lunch, and dinner. McDonald's wants to develop a combo menu that includes rich proteins, less sugar, less fat, and high vitamins.McDonald's
came up with a plan to group the items with similar characteristics. Eventually, they came up with an unsupervised machine learning method to group similar
items. McDonald's provided the menu data with many features like a menu item, serving size, calories, fat, cholesterol, protein .etc.,

In this project, we attempted to provide a healthy diet for an individual, and we divided the whole dataset into four different categories: Breakfast, Main Menu,
Beverages menu, Side dishes menu. For each category, we tried to find out healthy and unhealthy menus based on the calories.

K-means clustering is used on the dataset to group similar menu items and predict the optimal combination of menu items. This work tries to know the
optimal set of McDonald's menu that a person can order daily nutrition intake.
