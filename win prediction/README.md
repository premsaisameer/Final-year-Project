IPL, the world's richest professional Twenty20 cricket league, Eight teams play with each other twice, one match will be on home ground, and another game
will be on the opponent's home ground. Developing a model to predict the winner of an IPL match is a real-world problem. Generally, match-winning will be
dependent on the pitch, toss decision, venue, and some more features like players of the team, overall weight of the team that is calculated based on the
points of each player in the team. 

Since the prediction of a cricket match is binary classification, i.e., team1 is the winner or team2 is the winner, we can use a machine learning model with binary output. Machine learning models can be
Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision tree, Random forest, KNN, Multilayer Perceptron(Neural network). Finally, a dataset that contains all the features
created and passed to each machine learning model. The Random Forest model predicted on the test dataset with 88% accuracy.
